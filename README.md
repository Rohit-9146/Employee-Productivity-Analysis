📊 Employee Productivity Analysis

Python & Power BI | Data Analytics Project

📌 Project Summary

This project focuses on analyzing employee performance data to measure productivity, identify key influencing factors, and provide actionable insights for improving organizational efficiency. The project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, from data preprocessing to dashboard visualization.

🎯 Business Problem

Organizations often struggle to understand what factors truly impact employee productivity. This project aims to answer:

How productive are employees across departments?

What factors influence productivity the most?

How can management improve performance using data?
